typing test

todo:

implement a caret/cursor on the word list

highlight word before submitting the word (pressing space) that indicates if it's typed wrong

make word list infinite/repeat word list for long duration typing tests

add autocorrect feature (eugene :joy_cat:) // done

implement live wpm tracker/counter/whatever // done

probably redesign how accuracy is calculated
