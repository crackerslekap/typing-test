typing test



todo:

implement a caret/cursor on the word list

truncate text and allow new lines to appear

make word list infinite/repeat word list for long duration typing tests

add autocorrect feature (eugene :joy_cat:)

implement live wpm tracker/counter/whatever

probably redesign how accuracy is calculated
